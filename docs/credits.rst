This package was developed by me, **Laura Fontanesi**, with the help of **Amir Hosein Hadian Rasanan**. It is part of ongoing scientific work at the University of Basel and University of Hamburg, in collaboration with Prof. JÃ¶rg Rieskamp and Prof. Sebastian Gluth.

When using this package or part of the code for your own research, I ask you to **cite us** (**INSERT PREPRINT HERE**) and to always perform a parameter recovery, to make sure that everything is working as it should. Even though we tested all functions, I cannot assure that it will work perfectly on all platforms and data formats. Therefore, feedback on usage and issues is especially welcomed at this stage :)

If you have any questions or would like to contribute, you can write me at laura.fontanesi@unibas.ch.
