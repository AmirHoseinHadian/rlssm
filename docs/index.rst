Welcome to rlssm's documentation
================================

`rlssm` is a Python package for fitting **reinforcement learning** (RL) models, **sequential sampling models** (DDM, RDM, LBA, ALBA, and ARDM), and **combinations of the two**, using **Bayesian parameter estimation**. 

Parameter estimation is done at an individual or hierarchical level using `CmdPyStan`_, the Python interface to CmdStan, which provides access to the Stan compiler. Stan performs Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
